   cd backend || frontend

3. <b>Install Dependencies</b>: Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

   npm install

   yarn

4. <b>Setup Environment Variables</b>: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the variables mentioned in .env.sample

5. <b>Start the Development Server</b>: Run the following command to start the development server:

   npm start

6. <b>Access the App</b>: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000[server], http://localhost:5173[frontend]` to access the app. You can now use the app locally on your machine, connected to your MySQL database using the credentials specified in the `.env` file.
